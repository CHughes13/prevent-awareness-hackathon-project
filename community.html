        <!-- The following information is largely pulled from the gov.uk website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-prevent-duty-safeguarding-learners-vulnerable-to-radicalisation/managing-risk-of-radicalisation-in-your-education-setting-->

    <div><h2>Radicalisation risk indicators</h2>
        <p> There is no single route to radicalisation. However, there are some behavioural traits that could indicate that a learner is susceptible to radicalisation into terrorism.

            Radicalisation is not a linear process. Learners may express a combination of behaviours at different times. Designated safeguarding leads (DSLs) should consider an individual’s behaviour in the context of wider influencing factors and vulnerabilities.
            
            In most cases, you should speak with the learner and their parents or carers (if under 18). You should also consider contextual, vulnerability and protective factors to make a comprehensive assessment of risk and harm.
            
            Keep a written record of all concerns, discussions and decisions made, and the reasons for those decisions.
            
            Tell the police immediately if you think a learner:
            
               <ul>
                <li>is about to put themselves or others in immediate danger</li>
                <li>appears to be involved in planning to carry out a criminal offence</li>
               </ul> 
                 </p></div>
    <div>
        <h2>Identifying radicalisation</h2>
        <p>The official government levels of risk in education settings are:

            <ul>
            <li>low risk</li>
            <li>at risk</li>
            <li>medium risk</li>
            <li>high risk</li></ul>
        
        A learner can move very quickly between the risk categories. You should deal with any escalation of risk immediately and record this in their file.
        
        If you’re unsure about the level of need, you should ask for advice from:
        
            <ul>
                <li>your local children’s social care team (find contact details at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-child-abuse-to-local-council" target="_blank">child abuse to a local council</a>)</li>
                <li>your local authority Prevent team</li>
                <li>other Prevent partners</li>
            </ul>
            
            </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>What to do at each level of risk</h2>
        <h3>Low risk behaviours</h3>
        <p>Low risk means there’s no evidence to suggest the learner is susceptible to radicalisation into terrorism. Low risk behaviours, when seen alone, would not necessarily need to be explored further.

            Low risk behaviours include:
        
        <ul>
            <li>holding strong opinions or values (non-violent or non-extremist)</li>
            <li>criticising government policies</li>
            <li>adopting visible signs, for example wearing clothing (non-violent or non-extremist), to express identity or sense of belonging</li>
            <li>being active on social media</li>
            <li>taking a keen interest in national and international affairs</li>
            <li>demonstrating support and supporting causes, for example animal rights (non-violent)</li>
            <li>showing new interest in a political ideology or religion</li>
            <li>holding or expressing conservative values or practices, whether traditional, cultural or religious (unless they cause harm to a child or others, for example female genital mutilation)</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Low risk: what to do</h3>
        <p>Where there is low risk, you should think about:
            <ul>
                <li>talking informally to the learner about the changes in their behaviour</li>
                <li>providing an opportunity to debate controversial issues in a safe space</li>
                <li>offering information about how to keep safe online</li>
            </ul>
            The Prevent duty guidance says that schools and FE providers should be safe spaces in which learners can understand and discuss sensitive topics, including terrorism and the extremist ideas that are part of terrorist ideology, and to learn how to challenge these ideas.

            Regular Prevent training will help staff understand what radicalisation means and why learners may be susceptible to becoming a terrorist or supporting terrorism.
        </p>

        <h3>At risk behaviours</h3>
        <p>
            A learner at risk may be showing behaviours that could increase their risk and vulnerability to radicalisation.

            If a learner is showing at risk behaviour, you should explore this further to see if you need to make a Prevent referral.

            At risk behaviour includes:
            <ul>
                <li>being drawn to conspiracy theories</li>
                <li>beginning to isolate themselves from family and friends</li>
                <li>viewing or engaging with inappropriate online content and having uncontrolled or unsupervised access to the internet</li>
                <li>expressing concerns about being victimised, for example feeling under attack</li>
                <li>discriminating against other individuals or groups of people</li>
                <li>a sudden change in behaviour</li>
                <li>showing interest in extremists or extreme groups</li>
                <li>expressing views that divide us, for example talking about ‘us’ and ‘them’</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>At risk: what to do</h3>
        <p>
            If you think a learner is at risk, you should look at their behaviour and gather all the information you need to make a full assessment of risk and harm.

            You should ask yourself:
            <ul>
                <li>if you have enough information to make a comprehensive assessment</li>
                <li>what’s happened in the past to trigger the incident</li>
                <li>if this is an isolated incident or a pattern of behaviour</li>
                <li>what else you know and if there any relevant vulnerability factors</li>
                <li>if there are any relevant contextual factors - for example, previous safeguarding concerns, behaviour, attendance, attainment, general wellbeing</li>
                <li>if there are any protective factors - for example, supportive personal relationships with peers and family, environmental factors such as school, college, provider or home life</li>
            </ul>

            You should then:
            <ul>
                <li>talk to the learner in a safe space</li>
                <li>talk to the parents or carers (if under 18) about your concerns</li>
                <li>make a holistic assessment of vulnerability, examining risk and protective factors</li>
            </ul>
            When asking for advice, you do not need to identify the learner. Keep a written record of all concerns, discussions and decisions made, and the reasons for those decisions.

            The best person to speak to a learner is any professional, parent or carer (if under 18) who has a good relationship with them.

            If you think the risk is escalating, follow your Prevent referral procedures and read the guidance for medium or high-risk cases.
        </p>
        <h3>Medium risk behaviour</h3>
        <p>
            Medium risk means a learner is at heightened risk of radicalisation. There may be several indicators of risk.

            If the learner is at risk of harm, you should make a Prevent referral immediately.

            Medium risk behaviour includes:
            <ul>
                <li>legitimising the use of violence to defend ideology or cause</li>
                <li>accessing extremist or terrorist websites, forums and publications</li>
                <li>expressing dehumanising views</li>
                <li>expressing an interest to travel to a conflict zone</li>
                <li>being in contact with a group or individuals known to support a violent extremist ideology, either online or in real life</li>
                <li>expressing persistent intolerance towards groups of people perceived as ‘other’ - this may be based on protected characteristics such as gender, religion or ethnicity, but not exclusively</li>
                <li>demonstrating a fixation with weaponry or explosives (this may include posing in concerning photographs or videos with weaponry), without an otherwise reasonable explanation</li>
                <li>being obsessed with massacre, or extreme or mass violence, without targeting a particular group (for example, high school shootings)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <h3>Medium risk: what to do</h3>
            <p>
                If you suspect a learner is at medium risk, you should assess their vulnerability and examine the risk and protective factors.

                You should ask yourself:

                <ul>
                    <li>if there’s reasonable cause to suspect that the learner is suffering or likely to suffer significant harm</li>
                    <li>what the risks are and what would happen if these needs are not met - what the impact will be on the learner - what you’re worried about</li>
                    <li>what else you know and if there are any relevant vulnerability factors</li>
                    <li>if there are any relevant contextual factors - for example, previous safeguarding concerns, behaviour, attendance and attainment records and general wellbeing</li>
                    <li>if there are any protective factors - for example, supportive personal relationships with peers and family, environmental factors such as school, college, provider or home life</li>
                </ul>
                If the learner is suffering from or is at risk of harm including vulnerability to radicalisation, you should act immediately and follow your internal safeguarding policy, including the designated safeguarding lead considering making a referral to Prevent . Your Prevent partners may give you advice or forward the referral on to Channel as appropriate.

                Channel is a multi-agency partnership that supports people identified as at risk of being drawn into terrorism. Channel focuses on early intervention to provide support at an early stage.

                You should also carry out an assessment to identify whether any needs should be met by more than one agency, for example child and adolescent mental health services. If you’re not sure if you should do this, your local authority may suggest this when you make the Prevent referral.

                When you share information about a child or young person who is under 18, you should try to get parental consent but only if it is safe to do so. Do not put the child or young person in more danger.
            </p>
            
            <h3>High risk behaviour</h3>
            <p>
                High risk means a learner is at significant risk. There’s evidence that they’re currently exposed to terrorist or extremist activity and there’s a significant risk to their safety.

                If they’re showing high risk, criminal behaviour, tell the police immediately.

                High risk, criminal behaviour includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>verbally or physically attacking someone due to their race, religion, sexuality and so on</li>
                    <li>committing violent acts guided by a violent extremist ideology or group</li>
                    <li>taking part in any proscribed violent extremist group (financing, sharing material online, recruiting others and so on)</li>
                    <li>having a ‘kill list’ or detailed plan to carry out mass violence</li>
                    <li>producing or sharing terrorist material offline or online</li>
                    <li>recruiting others to a proscribed terrorist group or organisation</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>High risk: what to do</h3>
            <p>You should ask yourself if the learner:
                <ul>
                    <li>needs support from more than one agency</li>
                    <li>is about to put themselves or others in danger</li>
                    <li>is at risk due to actions of their parents or carers, or wider family members</li>
                    <li>has made violent threats to your setting</li>
                </ul>

                Tell the police immediately if you suspect a learner:

                <ul>
                    <li>is about to put themselves or others in danger by travelling to join a proscribed organisation, or</li>
                    <li>appears to be involved in planning to carry out a criminal offence</li>
                </ul>
                If you suspect a learner is likely to commit an attack on your setting, contact the police and local authority for immediate support.

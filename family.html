       <div> <h2>What could make my child vulnerable to radicalisation? </h2>

    
        <p> There are many reasons that can make a young person vulnerable to exploitation by extremists. This includes having a low self-esteem or a lack of belonging, or if they have been the victim of bullying or discrimination, which has left them feeling isolated.

            Radicalisation can take place online, or face to face by someone they know including friends and family, or by contact with extremist groups. Sometimes curiosity can lead children or teenagers to seek out the groups themselves, or research information they feel supports their views.
            

    </p>

    <h3>Acting early can protect your child from extremism </h3>

    
        <p> Parents and family members are best placed to notice any small changes taking place and so it’s important to trust your instincts and if you’re worried, reach out for advice.

            If you think it, tell someone. It’s probably nothing, but it could be something. By acting early you can get your child the help and support they might need to choose a new pathway before it’s too late.
            
            

    </p>

    <h3>Some key indicators of radicalisation to watch out for in your child are: </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>are they becoming increasingly isolated from family and friends?</li>
        <li>do you feel like they are talking as if from a script?</li>
        <li>are they unwilling to engage with you about their views?</li>
        <li>are they becoming increasingly angry about issues or events they feel are unfair or unjust?</li>
        <li>are they being secretive about who they are meeting online or in person?</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Signs of radicalisation- what to look for</h2>
    <p>There are many factors that can make someone vulnerable to radicalisation. They can apply to any age, social class, religion, ethnic or educational background.

        More important than any one specific sign is the sense that something is not quite right with the person you’re worried about. You could spot one sign or a combination of signs that are increasing in intensity. 
        
        Sometimes they can be indicators of other underlying issues or challenges that are not connected to radicalisation. If you are concerned, trust your instincts and contact us or one of the organisations listed on the website for advice.
        </p>

        <h3>Signs and Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>There is no single route to radicalisation. However, there are certain behaviours you can watch out for that we often see when someone is being led down the path of extremism. These signs and vulnerabilities are not listed in any order of importance. Our experience shows that some of these behaviours and vulnerabilities can make a person more at risk of being exploited. Identifying them doesn't necessarily mean someone is being radicalised. There can be other explanations behind the behaviours you are seeing. If you are worried, then act early and reach out for help to discuss your concerns.</p>

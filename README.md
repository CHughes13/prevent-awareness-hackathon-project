<b>Hackathon 1 Safeguarding website -: Lorcan and the Gits</b>

<b>Team</b> Lead: John Hookes

<b>Team members</b>: Tina Hughes, Leander Ots, Lorcan (in spirit)

<b>Project</b>: Prevent Awareness Website

<b>Description</b>

A website with information regarding the government’s PREVENT strategy - a strategy countering radicalisation in e.g. the workforce, schools and families.

The current website is in a MVP state with our team’s ‘must have’ webpages. A home page briefly illustrating what PREVENT is, three webpages outlining the steps a member of the public can take depending on whether their situation is in a family, school or business, a list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) and a list of other useful resources.

Other pages that would be built (‘nice to haves’) with more time include positive and negative case studies, as well as information for young people.

<b>Usage</b>

The website is meant to be useful for different members of the public so that they can easily find resources regarding PREVENT. 

<b>License</b>
